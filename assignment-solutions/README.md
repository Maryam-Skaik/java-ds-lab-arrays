# ✅ Assignment Solutions – Arrays Module

This folder contains **model solutions** for the Arrays assignments in the
Java Data Structures Lab.

📌 These solutions were published **after the semester ended**
to support revision, self-study, and future reference.

## 📚 Included Problems

### 1️⃣ Palindrome Check
- Uses the two-pointer technique
- Demonstrates symmetric comparison in arrays
- Time: O(n), Space: O(1)

### 2️⃣ Remove All Occurrences
- Manual shifting inside arrays
- Highlights the concept of logical size
- No additional data structures used

### 3️⃣ Merge Two Sorted Arrays
- Efficient linear merge algorithm
- Reinforces pointer-based traversal
- Foundation for merge sort

## 🎯 Educational Goals

These solutions aim to:
- Reinforce array traversal and manipulation
- Emphasize algorithmic thinking
- Clarify time and space complexity
- Avoid built-in shortcuts to strengthen fundamentals

---

## ⚠️ Notes for Students

- Do not treat these as memorization material
- Focus on understanding **why each step is done**
- Try rewriting the solutions without looking
